## Welcome!

I am a PhD student in Economics at University College London, supervised by [Vincent Sterk](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~uctpvst/index.htm) and [Morten Ravn](https://sites.google.com/view/mortenoravn/home). 

My research interests are in macroeconomics, in particular in firm dynamics and labor markets.
