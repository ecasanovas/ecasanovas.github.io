#    summary: |
#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## Welcome!

I am a PhD student in Economics at University College London, supervised by [Vincent Sterk](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~uctpvst/index.htm) and [Morten Ravn](https://sites.google.com/view/mortenoravn/home). 

My research interests are in macroeconomics, in particular in firm dynamics and labor markets.
